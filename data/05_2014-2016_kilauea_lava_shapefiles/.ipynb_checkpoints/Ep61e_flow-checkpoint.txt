    Description:
      Abstract: These feature data are part of a larger dataset containing shapefiles and associated metadata showing evolution of the "June 27th" lava flow (Puʻu ʻŌʻō eruptive episode 61e) that was active at Kīlauea volcano from June 27, 2014, to June 8, 2016. The full dataset contains (1) an attributed polyline shapefile and (2) an attributed polygon shapefile with features that represent the outline and extent of the flow on 35 different dates. The dataset also contains (3) an attributed polyline shapefile with features that represent the eruptive fissures associated with this episode of the eruption and the principle ground cracks that were occupied by lava during lava flow emplacement, and (4) an attributed polyline shapefile with features representing the mapped extent of the active lava tube on six different dates. In total, this dataset contains four shapefiles, each with an associated  metadata files in .txt and .xml formats. The geologic lines (lava flow contacts, the eruptive fissures, the ground cracks, and the lava tubes) were mapped on the ground or during helicopter reconnaissance flights using a handheld GPS, were digitized from satellite imagery or orthorectified aerial imagery (orthomosaics), were provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Advanced Systems Center, or were (in a few instances) inferred. The relevant sources for each feature are assigned in the metadata attribute tables, but a lookup table for the data sources (DataSource.txt) is also included for convenience.
      Purpose: The full dataset shows the evolution of the "June 27th" lava flow, which was active from June 27, 2014, to June 8, 2016, and threatened the town of Pāhoa, on the Island of Hawaiʻi. The dataset also includes the eruptive fissures, the principle ground cracks that were occupied by lava during emplacement of the June 27th flow, and the lava tube system that developed. This dataset and its associated metadata (for example, this document) were subjected to the same review standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports.  The review included checks for topological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic extent. The reviewers checked the metadata for completeness and accuracy. The dataset was compiled in ArcMap, a commercial Geographic Information System (GIS) by Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) of Redlands, California.

    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Attributes were assigned, and checked against source materials, by the authors and are accurate to a high level of confidence.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: Polygon and polyline shapefiles were confirmed to not self-intersect. Flow polygons were confirmed to share edges with flow contact polylines.
    Completeness_Report: The full dataset includes the extent of the June 27th lava flow (Kīlauea, Hawaiʻi) as mapped on 35 different dates (with each date showing additive changes to flow since the previous date), the trace of the lava tube system as mapped on 6 dates, the location of the fissures associated with the June 27th flow, and the location of the principal ground cracks that were occupied by the June 27th flow during its emplacement.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The horizontal positional accuracy of lava flow polygons is inherited from the related flow contacts polyline shapefile. See the flow contacts shapefile metadata for details.

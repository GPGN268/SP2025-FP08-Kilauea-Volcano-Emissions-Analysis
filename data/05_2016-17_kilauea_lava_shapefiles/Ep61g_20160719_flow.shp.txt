    Description:
      Abstract: These data contain the geologic polygon for the Puu Oo 61g lava flow for July 19, 2016.
      Purpose: These feature data are the geologic polygon for the Puu Oo 61g lava flow for July 19, 2016. See entity information of corresponding polyline shapefile for boundary type and accuracy.
      Supplemental_Information: This dataset contains the geologic polygon for the the Puu Oo 61g lava flow for July 19, 2016.  The scale of the source map limits the spatial resolution (scale) of the database to 1:24,000 or smaller. The content and character of the digital publication, as well as methods for obtaining the digital files, are described here. The database was compiled in ArcMap, a commercial Geographic Information System (GIS) by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) of Redlands, California.

    Use_Constraints: Uses of this digital geologic map should not violate the spatial resolution of the data. Although the digital form of the data removes the constraint imposed by the scale of a printed paper map, the detail and accuracy inherent in map scale are also present in the digital data. The fact that this database was edited for a scale of 1:24,000 means that higher resolution information is not present in the dataset. Plotting at scales larger than these will not yield greater real detail, although it may reveal fine-scale irregularities below the intended resolution of the database. Similarly, where this database is used in combination with other data of higher resolution, the resolution of the combined output will be limited by the lower resolution of these data. Acknowledgment of the U.S. Geological Survey would be appreciated in products derived from these data.

    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: See Entity_Attribute_Information
      Quantitative_Attribute_Accuracy_Assessment:
        Attribute_Accuracy_Value: See Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation
        Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation: Attribute accuracy is described, where present, with each attribute that is defined in the relevant sections.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: Polyline topology was validated and repaired in a file geodatabase, then a polygon shapefile was constructed from the polylines.
    Completeness_Report: The report is intended to describe completely the volcanic products, vent locations, and structural features at 1:24,000 scale. Geological information mappable only at larger scales has been omitted.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Well-located data items are intended to have a horizontal positional accuracy better than 0.5 mm at 1:24,000 scale, or 12 m on the ground. The general positional accuracy of the polygon boundary is indicated qualitatively within the AccuracyMe field in the corresponding polyline shapefile's table.
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
        Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: No Vertical positional data recorded.
    Lineage:
      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: Lines were digitized by hand as vectors or track files imported from handheld GPS and edited on-screen. Polygon and region topology were created; each line, polygon, and region was tagged on-screen. Then converted to shapefile(s) and then ArcMap document created.

# Kīlauea Volcano Hazards Analysis
Clara Pugh and Lillian Hanson


## Problem Statement/Introduction
We analyzed geohazards associated with the Kīlauea volcano in Hawaii. Kīlauea is currently one of the world's most active volcanos, and it is a shield volcano. We wanted to look at how the different forms of volcanic emissions that Kīlauea produces are related to each other. We looked at lava flows, volcanic plume heights, SO2 emissions, and the elevation over time of a lava lake in one of Kīlauea's craters, all using data from the USGS.

--> maybe put a map of hawaii that shows location of Kīlauea

## Our Process
We first found our data on the USGS data page for the Kīlauea volcano. The data for the lava flows was in shapefile format, while the rest was in csv format. We used numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and geopandas to assist with our analysis and visualizations.

## Limitations
We focused on data within a range from about 2008-2018, with many of our datasets only covering a few years of time. This means that while the data from each phenomenon that we graphed overlaps in its timeframe with other graphs, not all of our data was taken over the sem timeframes, so we do not have a complete view of how each phenomenon was changing at every time.

## Lava Flows
add lava flow animation

![2016-2017 Lava Flows](../figures/2016-17_lava.png)

We can see that there was a lot of expansion of the lava flow from May to August 2016, and then it started slowing down its growth

## Volcanic Plume Height
![Plume Height](../figures/plume_height.png)

We see in this that the elevation of the volcanic plume above Kilauea was highly variable, although it reached some peaks around the beginning and middle of 2014.

## Lava Lake Elevation
![Lava Lake Elevation](../figures/lava_lake_elev.png)

We can see in this that from 2010 to 2018, the surface elevation of the lava lake on Kilauea (within the within Halemaʻumaʻu crater) was rising fairly steadily, until the volcano began to erupt in the 2018 lower East Rift Zone, which pulled a lot of the magma out from the volcano, and caused the lava lake to drain rapidly.

## SO2 Emissions

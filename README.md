### Short 1-2 sentence summary:
This project will analyze geohazards associated with the Kīlauea volcano. The analysis will specifically focus on lava-flow-induced hazards. 

### Some introductory background information:
Kīlauea is an active shield volcano on the island of Hawaii. It is one of the world's most active volcanoes. It stems off of Mauna Loa, another large shield volcano in the area. It presents as a basaltic volcano. It most recently erupted in June 2024. [1] 

### Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s):
How are the size/volumes of lava flows and lava plumes related?

### Datasets you will use (with links, if available):

Datasets with GIS shapefiles of lava flows at Kīlauea, can be analyzed with GeoPandas:
- https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cdd9871e4b029273746360f
- https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af60d04e4b0da30c1b5fa5a
- https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/597230e4e4b0ec1a4885edc1

This dataset has volcanic plume data also from Kīlauea, formatted in csv files that are accessed with pandas:

Data from Kilauea relating to SO2 emissions:

### Tools/packages you’ll use (with links):
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Planned methodology/approach:
- Analyze lava flows over time at different time periods
- Compare this data numerically to lava plume/gas release volume for the same eruptions

### Expected outcomes:
- We expect that higher volumes of lava flow would be correlated with higher volumes of gas emissions and more/higher volumes of volcanic plumes
